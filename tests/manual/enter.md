## Enter key

Test the <kbd>Enter</kbd>kbd> key support.

### Notes:

* Enter at the end of a heading should create a new paragraph.
* In the middle of a heading should split it.
* <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd> should have <kbd>Enter</kbd> behavior.
* The selection should always be moved to the newly created block.
* Select all + <kbd>Enter</kbd> should leave an empty paragraph.
